### findings: 

1. By using the lottery id, I can iterate over the objects listed in the awards list.
by example here by using the id selector, is easy to look for the "Sortero Extraordinario N.390" because it has the `id=177`
Also in many cases is easy to guess what will be the next URL because all the "Sorteos Ordinarios" have a consecutive number like: `180`,`181`,`183`,`184`.
While the "Sorteos Extraordinarios" have these kind of numbers: `177`,`182`,`188`,`192`

So we will look for the new list awards by using the "id", 

2.
